# mako's timer

A better design for timers.

Usable with just one hand.

Requires one fewer keystroke in the making of timers.

Maintains stable colors and positions for pinned timers, while making them small enough to fit on the first screen, so that you'll always be able to quickly find the one you're looking for.

Supports timers that don't require the user to spend time getting them out and dismissing them before they'll shut up.

<!-- Supports chained timers. -->

## audio assets

These are currently not committed, as I haven't decided which ones I want to include.

credit goes mostly to [Kenney](kenney.nl) for the short audio sound effects.
